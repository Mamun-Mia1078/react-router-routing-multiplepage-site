The most widely used version throughout the 2000,s was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999 ML is a standard markup language that is used to create other markup languages. Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML (Geography Markup Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication). Since each of these languages was written in a common language (XML), their content can easily be shared across applications. This makes XML potentially very powerful, and it's no surprise that the W3C would create an XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML). XHTML became an official standard in 2000, and was updated in 2002. XHTML is very similar to HTML, but has stricter rules. Strict rules are necessary for all XML languages, because without it, interoperability between applications would be impossible. You'll learn more about the differences between HTML and XHTML in Unit 2. The following table shows a list of many of the types of content that can be added to web pages using different versions of HTML. In the early days of the Web, HTML (version 1.2) was very simple, but over time new versions were released that added more and more features. Still, if web designers wanted to add content or features that HTML didn't support, they would have to do so with non-standard proprietary technologies such as Adobe Flash. These technologies would require users to install browser plug-ins, and in some cases meant that certain users would be unable to access the content (for example, iPhones and iPads don't support Flash). \"\n}, {\n  id: 2,\n  title: \"History Of CSS\",\n  body: \" Cascading style sheets (CSS) were the World Wide Web Consortium's answer to the development, in the mid-1990s, of a number of presentational HTML elements that threatened to blur the distinction between the appearance of a document, i.e. what the document looks like, and its underlying structure and meaning. ithin little over a year of Netscape's introduction of the <font> tag in 1995, W3C had little option but to include the new tag in the HTML 3.2 specification, which was published as a W3C Recommendation in January 1997. However, they had already started work on CSS. The first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS 1) was released in 1996, providing web authors with the means to separate the code that defined the appearance of a web page from the code that defined its content. Unfortunately, it would be over three years before any of the major web browsers managed to implement the bulk of the CSS specification. As a consequence, the adoption of CSS by web authors was initially somewhat slow. Meanwhile CSS 2, essentially a superset of CSS 1, was released in 1998. The release was perhaps somewhat premature, since CSS 2 suffered from a number of errors and was consequently reformulated as CSS 2.1. CSS 2.1 fixed the errors in the CSS 2 specification, removed some of the feature that were either poorly supported or not supported at all by web browsers, and added new features to bring the specification in line with extensions that had already been implemented by browser vendors. Even so, work would continue on the specification for a number of years, with CSS 2.1 finally being published as an official WC3 recommendation in 2011. Meanwhile, in 1998, work had already begun on CSS 3. WC3 had obviously learned from their experiences with CSS 2 that there were no guarantees that browser vendors would adopt new CSS features. Even if they did, there could be a significant delay between the issuing of a draft specification and its adoption, and browser implementations would not necessarily adhere to the specification as written.Unlike previous specifications, CSS 3 is not a single monolithic specification. It is published as a set of separate documents known as modules. Each module deals with a relatively small subset of the overall specification, and either adds new features or refines and extends existing features. All additions and enhancements to the specification are written in order to be backward-compatible with older versions of CSS.  \"\n}, {\n  id: 3,\n  title: \"Javascript...\",\n  body: \"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
